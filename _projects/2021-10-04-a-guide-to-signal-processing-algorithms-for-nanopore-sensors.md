Nanopore technology holds great promise for a wide range of
applications such as biomedical sensing, chemical detection, desalination, and
energy conversion. For sensing performed in electrolytes in particular, abundant
information about the translocating analytes is hidden in the fluctuating
monitoring ionic current contributed from interactions between the analytes
and the nanopore. Such ionic currents are inevitably affected by noise; hence,
signal processing is an inseparable component of sensing in order to identify the
hidden features in the signals and to analyze them. This Guide starts from
untangling the signal processing flow and categorizing the various algorithms
developed to extracting the useful information. By sorting the algorithms under
Machine Learning (ML)-based versus non-ML-based, their underlying architectures
and properties are systematically evaluated. For each category, the development
tactics and features of the algorithms with implementation examples
are discussed by referring to their common signal processing flow graphically
summarized in a chart and by highlighting their key issues tabulated for clear
comparison. How to get started with building up an ML-based algorithm is subsequently
presented. The specific properties of the ML-based algorithms are then discussed in
terms of learning strategy, performance evaluation, experimental repeatability and
reliability, data preparation, and data utilization strategy. This Guide is concluded
by outlining strategies and considerations for prospect algorithms.
