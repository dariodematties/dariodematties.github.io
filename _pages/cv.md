Service and leadership
======
* Currently I am the moderator and scientific coordinator for the [ Trillion Parameter Consortium (TPC) ](https://tpc.dev/tpc-seminar-series/) seminar series. [ TPC ](https://tpc.dev/) is an international community of nearly 1,000 participants from over 100 organizations including universities, research laboratories and institutes, and industry. TPC fosters collaborations toward the creation and responsible use of generative artificial intelligence in an open community and aspires to create a global network of resources and expertise that can help to grow that community.
